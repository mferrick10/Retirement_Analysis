## Project Summary

My analysis concludes that the company will be forced to hire a considerable amount of employees over the next few years with 32859
employees who are eligible for retirement.![employees retiring](table_images/employees_retiring.PNG) ![title count of retiring employees](table_images/title_count_retiring_employees.PNG)
This leaves plenty of mentors available for the 1940 current employees who arent eligible
for hire as well as the new hires for the retiring employees as they leave.![eligible for mentor](table_images/eligible_for_mentor.PNG) 
We should provide further analysis on the exact date in which the employees eligible for retirement will be leaving to attempt to 
pair them up more effectively.
